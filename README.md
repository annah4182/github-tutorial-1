## Initial Setup
##### This is how you make a github account where things form git get send to the cloud(github)
To set up your github account all you would need to do is head to this link here [GitHub](https://github.com/join)

## Repository Setup
In order to set up a repository go to github and login then hit the plus sign in the right hand corner then click on new repository give it a name then you click create repository at the bottem you add a description but thats up to you.  
You also want to be on ssh all the time if you are cloning or connecting the the remote or repository.
Now in order to connect your self to the remote to the cloud
Type git init in the beginning to really start
#### git add .
So when you add all the code you wanted then you have to save it using  
#### git commit -m "message"
